# shell-search

Application launcher for [freedesktop](https://freedesktop.org) systems.
Searches for `.desktop` at lets you pick one to launch, or a specific action of
that desktop-file to launch.

Rust because why not, gtk because at least it's not Qt, glib/gio desktop search
because I can't be bothered write something that sucks less.

Use `Ctrl-Space` to see a list of actions that can be launched.
